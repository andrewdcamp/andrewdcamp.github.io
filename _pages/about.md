## My day job
I'm currently a member of Dow Chemical's Supply Chain Innovation team where I work alongside incredibly talented folks to bring cutting edge technology to supply chain operations.

I primarily work on supply chain modeling efforts. My day to day includes network optimization, material handling simulation, and applied machine learning.
